The implementation for the MAE is in the file autoencoder-Copy2.ipynb.
When it runs it uses the training data with 176 images and trains the MAE on it.
After it saves the encoder weights as a .pht file which then can be loaded in the main file so it can be used as pretrained encoder in another model.
